# Spring Boot Fintech Demo: Educational Project Report

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a modern approach to building a secure fintech web application using Spring Boot, Java, and web technologies. It covers user registration, authentication, account management, transactions, and post creation, all integrated with a simple frontend.

## Key Practices and Technologies
- **Spring Boot**: Rapid development of Java web applications with embedded server and auto-configuration.
- **Spring Security & JWT**: Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens, a best practice for stateless APIs.
- **JPA/Hibernate**: Object-relational mapping for easy database access and management.
- **RESTful API Design**: Clean separation of backend logic and frontend, following REST principles.
- **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)**: Simple, user-friendly interface for interacting with backend features.

## Design Process
1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Goal: Simulate a fintech app where users manage accounts, make deposits/withdrawals, view transactions, and create posts.
   - Security: Only authenticated users can access sensitive features.

2. **Backend Design**
   - Entities: User, Account, Transaction, Post.
   - Controllers: Expose endpoints for registration, login, account actions, transactions, and posts.
   - Services: Business logic for account management, transaction recording, and post creation.
   - Repository Pattern: Clean separation of data access using Spring Data JPA.

3. **Frontend Design**
   - Forms for registration, login, account actions, and post creation.
   - JavaScript for API calls and dynamic UI updates.
   - Error handling and feedback for user actions.

4. **Security**
   - JWT authentication for stateless, secure API access.
   - Passwords are hashed before storage (never stored in plain text).

5. **Educational Practices**
   - Code is modular and readable, following Java and Spring conventions.
   - Error handling is implemented for user feedback and debugging.
   - Database relationships (e.g., User â†” Account) are managed with JPA annotations.
   - Serialization issues (e.g., Hibernate proxies) are handled with `@JsonIgnoreProperties`.
