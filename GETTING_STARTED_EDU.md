## 1. Project Setup
**Why?** Every project needs a foundation. These tools and dependencies are industry standards for building secure, scalable Java web apps.

- **Install Prerequisites:**
  - *Java 17+*: The programming language used for backend logic.
  - *Maven*: A build tool that manages dependencies and project structure.
  - *IDE*: Makes coding easier with features like autocomplete and debugging.

- **Create a New Spring Boot Project:**
  - Use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) or your IDE to quickly scaffold a project. This saves time and ensures best practices.
  - *Spring Web*: Lets you build REST APIs and serve web pages.
  - *Spring Data JPA*: Simplifies database access using Java objects.
  - *Spring Security*: Adds authentication and authorization features.
  - *H2 Database*: An in-memory database for easy local testing.
  - *Lombok*: Reduces boilerplate code (getters/setters, constructors).

## 2. Basic Structure
**Why?** Organizing your code makes it easier to maintain, debug, and collaborate.

- **Understand the Folder Layout:**
  - `model`: Defines the data and relationships (like User, Account).
  - `repository`: Handles database operations (CRUD).
  - `service`: Contains business logic (how things work, rules).
  - `controller`: Exposes endpoints for frontend or API clients.
  - `static`: Holds frontend files for user interaction.
  - `application.properties`: Central place for configuration (DB, ports, etc).

## 3. Build the Domain Model
**Why?** The domain model is the heart of your app—it defines what data you store and how it relates.

- **Start with the User Entity:**
  - Represents a person using your app (login, profile, security).
  - Fields: username, password, name, email—core info for authentication and communication.
  - Implements `UserDetails` so Spring Security can manage logins.

- **Add Account, Transaction, and Post Entities:**
  - *Account*: Tracks each user's money, status, and currency.
  - *Transaction*: Records every change to an account (deposit, withdrawal, fee, etc.) for transparency and history.
  - *Post*: Lets users create content, which can be linked to payments or fees.

- **Use JPA Annotations:**
  - `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`: Tell Java and Spring how to map objects to database tables.
  - Relationships (`@OneToOne`, `@ManyToOne`): Connect users to accounts, transactions to accounts, etc.

## 4. Data Access Layer
**Why?** Repositories make it easy to read/write data without writing SQL by hand.

- **Create Repositories:**
  - Extend `JpaRepository` for each entity—this gives you CRUD methods for free.
  - Example: `UserRepository` (find users), `AccountRepository` (find accounts), etc.

## 5. Service Layer
**Why?** Services are where you put the "rules" of your app—how things work, what is allowed.

- **Write Business Logic:**
  - Services handle registration, authentication, account management, transactions, and posts.
  - Example: `UserService` (register/login users), `AccountService` (deposit/withdraw), etc.
  - Keeps controllers clean and focused on handling requests.

## 6. Security Setup
**Why?** Security protects user data and prevents unauthorized access.

- **Configure Spring Security:**
  - Use JWT for stateless authentication—no need to store sessions on the server.
  - Secure endpoints so only logged-in users can access sensitive data (like account info).
  - Hash passwords before saving—never store plain text passwords!

## 7. REST Controllers
**Why?** Controllers are the bridge between frontend and backend—they handle requests and send responses.

- **Expose API Endpoints:**
  - Registration, login, account actions, transaction history, post creation.
  - Use `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping` to define URLs and methods.
  - Each endpoint should validate input and call the right service method.

- **Create Simple HTML/CSS/JS Files:**
  - Registration and login forms: Let users sign up and sign in.
  - Account info, deposit/withdraw, transaction history, post creation: All main features accessible from the browser.
  - Use JavaScript to call backend APIs and update the UI—this makes the app interactive and responsive.

## 8. Testing and Debugging
**Why?** Testing ensures your app works as expected. Debugging helps you fix problems quickly.

- **Run the App:**
  - Use `./mvnw spring-boot:run` to start the server.
  - Test endpoints with Postman (API testing tool) or the frontend.

- **Check Logs and Errors:**
  - Read error messages and stack traces to debug issues—don't ignore them!
  - Use breakpoints and print statements to understand what's happening in your code.
